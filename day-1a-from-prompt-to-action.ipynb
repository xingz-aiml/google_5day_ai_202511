While optimized for Google's Gemini models and ecosystem, the ADK is model-agnostic and deployment-agnostic, meaning it can be used with various AI models and deployed in different environments. The ADK supports various agent types, including LLM-based, workflow, and custom agents, and facilitates the creation of multi-agent systems where agents can collaborate.
