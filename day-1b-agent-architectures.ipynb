    "In the previous notebook, you built a **single agent** that could take action. Now, you'll learn how to scale up by building **agent teams**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

    "- ✅ Learn when to use multi-agent systems in [Agent Development Kit (ADK)](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n",
    "- ✅ Build your first system using an LLM as a \"manager\"\n",
    "- ✅ Learn three core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to coordinate your agent teams\n",

    "> ❌ **Note:** Avoid using the **Run all** cells command as this can trigger a QPM limit resulting in 429 errors when calling the backing model. Suggested flow is to run each cell in order - one at a time. [See FAQ on 429 errors for more information.](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kaggle5daysofai/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs)\n",

One blustery evening, while tidying the dusty storage room, his fingers brushed against a loose floorboard. Beneath it lay a rolled parchment, surprisingly supple, unlike anything he’d ever seen. Unfurling it, Silas gasped. It was a map, but not of any coast he knew. Strange, swirling constellations marked the edges, and the landmasses were dotted with luminous symbols that pulsed with an inner, emerald light. The lines of rivers and mountains glowed with an ethereal blue, as if lit from within. A shiver, unrelated to the wind, traced its way down his spine. This was no ordinary chart; it was a whisper from a forgotten world.\n",
      "CriticAgent > This is a promising start to a story, effectively establishing atmosphere and introducing a compelling mystery. However, to elevate it further, here are a few suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Deepen Silas's reaction and internal conflict:** While Silas gasps and feels a shiver, we could explore his internal monologue more. What specific thoughts race through his mind? Does he question his sanity? Does this discovery spark a longing for something beyond his solitary existence? Showing his immediate emotional and mental response will make him a more relatable and complex character.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Add a sensory detail beyond sight:** The map is visually described with glowing elements, which is excellent. However, consider adding another sensory layer. Does the parchment have a scent? Does it feel warm to the touch? Is there a faint, almost imperceptible sound emanating from it? This can further enhance the otherworldly nature of the discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Hint at the map's potential purpose or origin:** While the mystery is compelling, a tiny hint about *why* this map exists or where it might lead could add another layer of intrigue without giving too much away. Perhaps a small, faded inscription, a symbol that Silas vaguely recognizes from an old sea shanty, or a feeling that the map is \"calling\" him. This would immediately raise the stakes and create anticipation for what comes next.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > The salt spray was a constant companion to Silas, just like the rhythmic pulse of the Fresnel lens. For twenty years, his world had been this tower, the sea, and the sky. He’d grown accustomed to the quiet, the solitude a comfortable cloak. One blustery evening, while tidying the dusty storage room, his fingers brushed against a loose floorboard.

It felt unnaturally warm against his calloused skin, and a faint, almost musical hum emanated from it. Unfurling it, Silas gasped.\n",

A shiver, unrelated to the wind, traced its way down his spine. *What is this?* he thought, his mind reeling. *Am I losing my grip after all these years alone?* Yet, beneath the fear, a forgotten ember of curiosity flickered. The map seemed to hum louder, a silent siren song. He noticed a faded inscription in a corner, a symbol that tugged at a distant memory, like a half-forgotten sea shanty his grandfather used to sing. This was no ordinary chart; it was a whisper from a forgotten world, a promise of something *more* than the endless horizon. A longing, sharp and unexpected, pierced through his practiced detachment.
