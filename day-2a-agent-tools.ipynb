    "- Agent A calls Agent B as a tool\n",
    "- Agent B's response goes **back to Agent A**\n",

    "- Agent A transfers control **completely to Agent B**\n",
    "- Agent B takes over and handles all future user input\n",
    "- Agent A is out of the loop\n",
    "- **Use case**: Handoff to specialists (like customer support tiers)\n",
