    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas where AI is making significant inroads. Here are some of the key new developments and trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** Instead of just screening existing compounds, generative AI models (like GANs and variational autoencoders) can now *design entirely new molecules* from scratch with specific desired properties. This is like having an AI architect that can create custom building blocks for drugs.\n",
      "*   **Developments:** These models are being trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties to learn the underlying rules of chemical structure and function. They can generate molecules predicted to bind to specific protein targets, have certain pharmacokinetic properties (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes the drug), and minimize toxicity.\n",
      "*   **Impact:** This dramatically expands the chemical space that researchers can explore, potentially leading to novel therapies for previously untreatable diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** AI can analyze complex biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, clinical data) to identify novel biological targets that play a critical role in disease pathogenesis. It can also help validate these targets by predicting their druggability and potential impact on disease progression.\n",
      "*   **Developments:** AI algorithms are getting better at sifting through \"omics\" data to find subtle patterns that human researchers might miss, linking specific genes or proteins to disease states. This helps prioritize which targets are most promising for drug development.\n",
      "*   **Impact:** Reduces the time and resources spent on identifying and validating targets, leading to a more efficient start to the drug discovery pipeline.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Accelerating Preclinical Testing and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** AI is being used to predict the efficacy, safety, and side effects of potential drug candidates *before* they are tested in animals or humans. This includes predicting ADMET properties (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity).\n",
      "*   **Developments:** Sophisticated AI models can now simulate how a drug might interact with biological systems, analyze large datasets from in vitro and in vivo experiments to identify trends, and even predict potential drug-drug interactions.\n",
      "*   **Impact:** Reduces the number of failed preclinical candidates, saving significant time and money. It also helps design more effective and safer compounds from the outset.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Drug Repurposing with AI:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** AI can scan existing databases of approved drugs and their known mechanisms of action, along with disease data, to identify potential new uses for these already-safe medications.\n",
      "*   **Developments:** AI can find unexpected connections between drug targets and disease pathways, suggesting that a drug approved for one condition might be effective against another.\n",
      "*   **Impact:** This is a faster and often less expensive route to new treatments because the safety profiles of these drugs are already well-established. This has been particularly impactful in areas like rare diseases and emerging infectious diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Enhanced Clinical Trial Design and Patient Stratification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **What it is:** While not strictly \"discovery,\" AI is also improving the *next step*: clinical trials. AI can help design more efficient trials by identifying optimal patient populations for testing, predicting which patients are most likely to respond to a drug, and even identifying potential issues in trial design.\n",
      "*   **Developments:** AI can analyze historical clinical trial data and patient characteristics to predict trial success rates, helping pharmaceutical companies make better decisions about which drugs to advance.\n",
      "*   **Impact:** Leads to more successful and faster clinical trials, getting effective drugs to patients sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Players and Initiatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Biotech and Pharma Companies:** Many major pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca) have established AI/ML divisions or partnered with AI-focused drug discovery companies.\n",
      "*   **AI-Native Drug Discovery Companies:** Numerous startups (e.g., Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Insitro, Atomwise) are built entirely around AI-driven drug discovery platforms and have secured significant funding.\n",
      "*   **Academic Research:** Universities are also heavily involved in pushing the boundaries of AI in drug discovery, publishing groundbreaking research and spinning out new companies.\n",
      "\n",
      "In essence, AI is transforming drug discovery from a process of educated guesswork and laborious trial-and-error into a more data-driven, predictive, and efficient scientific endeavor. The goal is to dramatically shorten the time it takes to bring life-saving medicines from the lab to patients.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second development I mentioned: **AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation**. This is a critical early step in the drug discovery process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me elaborate on what this entails and why it's so significant:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenge of Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before you can develop a drug, you need to identify a specific biological molecule (like a protein, enzyme, or receptor) that is involved in causing or perpetuating a disease. This molecule becomes your \"target.\" The drug is then designed to interact with this target in a way that corrects the disease process (e.g., by blocking an overactive enzyme, activating a deficient receptor, or inhibiting a harmful protein).\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, identifying these targets has been a painstaking process:\n",
      "*   **Limited Data:** Researchers relied on a combination of biological intuition, existing literature, and relatively small-scale experiments.\n",
      "*   **Complexity of Biology:** Biological systems are incredibly complex, with thousands of interacting molecules. Pinpointing the precise \"weak link\" or causal factor for a disease can be like finding a needle in a haystack.\n",
      "*   **Slow Pace:** Traditional methods are time-consuming and resource-intensive, often taking years to identify and validate a single promising target.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI Revolutionizes Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and making predictions from massive, complex datasets. Here's how it's applied to target identification:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Integrating Diverse Data Sources:**\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** AI can analyze DNA sequences to identify genes that are mutated or abnormally expressed in disease states.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** AI can study the proteins present in cells or tissues, looking for changes in abundance or modification that are linked to disease.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics (RNA-Seq):** AI analyzes RNA levels to understand which genes are actively being transcribed, indicating cellular activity related to disease.\n",
      "    *   **Epigenomics:** AI can look at modifications to DNA that affect gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence.\n",
      "    *   **Clinical Data:** AI can correlate genetic or molecular findings with patient outcomes, disease progression, and response to existing treatments.\n",
      "    *   **Scientific Literature:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) can sift through millions of research papers to identify potential connections and hypotheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Identifying Disease Signatures:**\n",
      "    *   AI algorithms can find subtle patterns or \"signatures\" within this integrated data that are unique to a particular disease. These signatures often point to specific pathways or molecules that are dysregulated.\n",
      "    *   **Example:** An AI might identify a cluster of genes whose expression changes in a specific way in cancer cells but not in healthy cells, suggesting a targetable pathway.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Prioritizing Potential Targets:**\n",
      "    *   Once potential targets are identified, AI can help prioritize them based on several factors:\n",
      "        *   **Druggability:** Is this target a type of molecule that can realistically be bound by a small molecule drug or antibody? (e.g., does it have a binding pocket?).\n",
      "        *   **Essentiality:** Is this target crucial for the disease process? Blocking it should have a significant impact.\n",
      "        *   **Specificity:** Will targeting this molecule primarily affect the disease and have minimal off-target effects on healthy tissues?\n",
      "        *   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** AI is also exploring ways to design therapies for targets previously considered \"undruggable\" (like certain protein-protein interactions).\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Validation through Prediction and Simulation:**\n",
      "    *   AI models can be trained to predict the likely consequences of modulating a target. For instance, if a target is inhibited, what other pathways are likely to be affected? This helps validate whether targeting it is likely to be beneficial.\n",
      "    *   Some AI platforms can even simulate the effects of target modulation on cellular or tissue models, providing a form of virtual validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Impact and Benefits:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** AI can analyze vast datasets in hours or days, a task that would take human researchers years.\n",
      "*   **Scope:** AI can explore a much wider range of biological hypotheses than humans alone.\n",
      "*   **Precision:** AI can identify more precise and relevant targets, leading to more effective drugs with fewer side effects.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover novel targets and pathways that might not have been apparent through traditional research methods.\n",
      "*   **Cost-Effectiveness:** By accelerating the early stages and reducing the number of failed experiments, AI can significantly lower the overall cost of drug discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, AI-powered target identification and validation acts as a powerful engine, sifting through the immense complexity of human biology to pinpoint the most promising biological Achilles' heels of diseases, thereby setting the stage for the design of effective new therapies.**\n",
