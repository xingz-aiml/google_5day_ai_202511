    "A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a **single, continuous conversation**. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.\n",

    "> - *User Input*: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "> - *Agent Response*: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "> - *Tool Call*: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",

      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are **continuous and significant new developments in drug discovery, heavily driven by AI and related technologies**. While I can't give you *breaking news* from the last few weeks, here are the key trends and advancements that have been prominent and are likely still evolving rapidly:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Areas of Recent Advancements in AI-Driven Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n",
      "    *   **De Novo Drug Design:** This is a huge area. AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and increasingly transformer-based models) are being trained on vast datasets of known molecules and their properties. They can then *generate entirely new molecular structures* that are predicted to have specific desired characteristics (e.g., binding to a particular target, having good solubility, low toxicity).\n",
      "    *   **Optimizing Existing Leads:** AI can take a known promising molecule and suggest modifications to improve its efficacy, reduce side effects, or enhance its pharmacokinetic properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "    *   **Omics Data Analysis:** AI is crucial for making sense of massive biological datasets (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics). It can identify novel disease targets (proteins, genes) that are implicated in a disease pathway.\n",
      "    *   **Network Biology:** AI helps map complex biological networks to understand how different components interact and identify key nodes that could be targeted for therapeutic intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Improved Prediction of Drug Properties (ADMET):**\n",
      "    *   **Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET):** Predicting how a drug will behave in the body and its potential toxicity early on is critical. AI models are getting much better at accurately forecasting these properties, saving significant time and resources by weeding out problematic candidates early.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Enhanced Clinical Trial Design and Optimization:**\n",
      "    *   **Patient Stratification:** AI can identify patient subgroups most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n",
      "    *   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** Models are being developed to predict the likelihood of success for a clinical trial based on preclinical data and trial design.\n",
      "    *   **Virtual Trials and Digital Twins:** While still nascent, there's research into using AI to create \"digital twins\" of patients or entire patient populations to simulate drug responses without needing as many human participants.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **AI in Biologics and Peptide Drug Discovery:**\n",
      "    *   While small molecules have seen extensive AI application, there's growing work on using AI for designing antibodies, peptides, and other protein-based therapeutics. This includes predicting protein folding and binding affinities.\n",
      "\n",
      "6.  **Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",

      "\n",
      "**Examples of Companies and Approaches Making Waves (historically):**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-driven drug discovery platform, including end-to-end AI pipelines for identifying targets, generating molecules, and predicting clinical outcomes. They have advanced several AI-discovered drugs into clinical trials.\n",
      "*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery, predicting how small molecules will bind to protein targets.\n",
      "*   **Exscientia:** Focuses on automating drug design and discovery, with AI playing a central role in optimizing molecule design.\n",
      "*   **BenevolentAI:** Integrates AI with vast scientific literature and biomedical data to identify new drug targets and therapeutic hypotheses.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In summary, the trend is towards AI becoming an indispensable partner in nearly every stage of the drug discovery pipeline, making it faster, cheaper, and more effective.** The ability of AI to process and learn from immense, complex datasets is revolutionizing how we find and develop new medicines.\n",

      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the **second development** I mentioned: **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a critical area because before you can design a drug, you need to know *what* to target. You need to identify a specific molecule (usually a protein or gene) that plays a crucial role in a disease, and for which modulating its activity could have a therapeutic benefit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a deeper dive into how AI is revolutionizing target identification and validation:\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Challenge Before AI:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Vast Biological Complexity:** The human body is incredibly complex. Diseases often involve intricate networks of interacting genes, proteins, and cellular pathways.\n",
      "*   **Data Overload:** For decades, researchers have been generating massive amounts of biological data through experiments like:\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** Sequencing DNA to understand genetic variations.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics:** Measuring RNA levels to see which genes are active.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** Studying the proteins present and their modifications.\n",
      "    *   **Metabolomics:** Analyzing small molecules involved in metabolism.\n",
      "*   **Manual Analysis Limitations:** Sifting through all this data manually or with traditional statistical methods is incredibly time-consuming, prone to human bias, and often fails to uncover subtle but critical patterns.\n",
      "*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many disease-relevant targets are difficult to design drugs for with conventional methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI Steps In:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and making predictions from complex, high-dimensional data. Here's how it's applied to target identification and validation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Integrating Multi-Omics Data:**\n",
      "    *   **The Power of Synergy:** AI can integrate data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics simultaneously. This allows researchers to see how changes in genes affect protein levels, which in turn influences metabolic pathways, providing a more holistic view of disease mechanisms.\n",
      "    *   **Identifying Causal Links:** AI algorithms can help distinguish correlation from causation, identifying which molecular changes are truly driving the disease rather than just being byproducts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Network Biology and Pathway Analysis:**\n",
      "    *   **Mapping Interactions:** AI can build sophisticated models of biological networks, showing how different proteins and genes interact. This helps researchers understand the intricate pathways that are dysregulated in disease.\n",
      "    *   **Identifying Bottlenecks and Key Nodes:** By analyzing these networks, AI can pinpoint specific proteins or genes that act as critical control points (\"bottlenecks\"). Inhibiting or activating these nodes can potentially disrupt the entire disease process.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Leveraging Literature and Real-World Evidence (RWE):**\n",
      "    *   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** AI-powered NLP can scan and analyze millions of scientific papers, clinical trial reports, and patient records. It can extract relationships between genes, diseases, drugs, and symptoms that might be missed by human researchers.\n",
      "    *   **Hypothesis Generation:** Based on the literature and RWE, AI can generate novel hypotheses about which targets are most promising for a particular disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n",
      "    *   **Beyond Binding:** Once a potential target is identified, AI can help assess its \"druggability\" – how likely it is that a small molecule or biologic can bind to it and elicit a desired effect. This involves predicting the target's structure, its binding pockets, and its functional relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Validation through Machine Learning Models:**\n",
      "    *   **Predictive Models:** AI can build models to predict patient outcomes or disease progression based on the activity of specific targets. If a model accurately predicts disease severity based on a target's expression or activity, it provides strong evidence for that target's role and potential as a therapeutic focus.\n",
      "    *   **Simulations:** In some cases, AI can be used to simulate the effects of modulating a target *in silico* (on a computer) before costly experimental validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this a \"development\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Before AI, identifying and validating drug targets was a much slower, more serendipitous, and often less precise process. Researchers relied heavily on existing knowledge, intuition, and painstaking, often single-variable experiments. AI allows for:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Speed:** Significantly faster analysis of massive datasets.\n",
      "*   **Comprehensiveness:** Ability to integrate disparate data sources and uncover complex relationships.\n",
      "*   **Objectivity:** Reducing human bias in hypothesis generation.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** Discovering targets that might have been overlooked with traditional methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "This advancement is foundational because a well-chosen, validated target is the bedrock of successful drug discovery. If you aim for the wrong target, even the most brilliant drug design will fail. AI is fundamentally changing the odds of finding the *right* targets, thus accelerating the entire drug development lifecycle.\n",
      "\n",
